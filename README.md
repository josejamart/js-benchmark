# js-benchmark


## Purpose

This project was created to make simple samples of different ways to implement frontend web applications and try to compare it. The current comparison is made by the performance, based in a some time measures and by the code. The performance comparison will tell us how the application will behave and how the user experience will be. The code will tell us other indicators as simplicity, understandability and maintainability. Soon I will try to also introduce the memory management.

The final aim is to could have enough information to could decide which framework use in each project, because not all frameworks can be used in all projects.

## Current tests

Now only two frameworks are tested, Backbone, and Backbone combined with React. But hope to could compare them with pure React and Angular2.

## Test execution

This section will be available soon.

## Conclusion

I think the conclusion can't be defined in a general way, that's it, to make a good conclusion each person has to put in the table the new application requirements, the team skills, the development methodology, etc. And after evaluating all variables plus the information can be gathered from this project each one could be able  to get his owns conclusions.

So, instead of made a conclusion which can be applied only to a little specific project I will give tools to each one could make his own conclusions.

## Contributing

I'm open to any contribution of test or new frameworks, but, as we are currently in the starting process,  please first check the current branches or ask me to don't make work twice.
